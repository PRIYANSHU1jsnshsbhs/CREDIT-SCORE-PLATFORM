# Making GitHub Repository Public

## Steps:
1. Go to: https://github.com/PRIYANSHU1jsnshsbhs/CREDIT-SCORE-PLATFORM
2. Click "Settings" tab (top right)
3. Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
4. Click "Change repository visibility"
5. Select "Make public"
6. Type the repository name to confirm
7. Click "I understand, change repository visibility"

## Benefits of Public Repository:
- ✅ Open source contribution
- ✅ Portfolio showcase
- ✅ Easy sharing with others
- ✅ Community feedback
- ✅ Better SEO for your project

## Security Note:
Your `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`, so your API keys remain secure.
Only the code structure will be public, not your sensitive credentials.
