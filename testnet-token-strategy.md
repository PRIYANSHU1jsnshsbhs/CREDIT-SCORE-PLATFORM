# Testnet Token Strategy Guide

## Current Situation
- Need: ~2.5 MATIC on Polygon Amoy 
- Have: ETH on Sepolia testnet
- Issue: No direct bridge between different testnets

## Solution 1: Multiple Faucet Requests (Recommended)
Since you need 2.5 MATIC and most faucets give 0.5-2 MATIC:

1. Polygon Faucet: https://faucet.polygon.technology/ (up to 2 MATIC)
2. Alchemy Faucet: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy (0.5 MATIC)  
3. QuickNode Faucet: https://faucet.quicknode.com/polygon/amoy
4. Chainlink Faucet: https://faucets.chain.link/polygon-amoy

Use different browsers/accounts if daily limits apply.

## Solution 2: Alternative Deployment Networks
If getting Amoy MATIC is difficult, consider:

### Polygon Mumbai (being deprecated but still active)
- More faucets available
- Same EVM environment  
- Easy migration to Amoy later

### Ethereum Sepolia (you already have ETH)
- Deploy directly on Sepolia
- No additional tokens needed
- Same user experience

## Solution 3: Reduced Gas Deployment
Deploy just the core contract first, add tier images later:
- Initial deployment: ~1 MATIC
- Add tier images: ~0.5 MATIC  
- More manageable with faucet limits
